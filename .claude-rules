# Claude Assistant Rules for this Repository

## File Organization
- ALL documentation files (.md except README.md) go in docs/ folder
- NEVER create documentation in root directory
- Keep root directory clean and organized

## Before Creating Files
1. Check if it's documentation → use docs/ folder
2. Verify path includes docs/ for any .md files except README.md
3. Maintain proper repository organization
