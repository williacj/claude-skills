# Academic Theological Writing Style Guide

## Formal Academic Tone

**Objectivity and Precision**
- Use third person for formal arguments ("This paper argues," "The evidence suggests")
- First person acceptable for personal research/observations ("I contend," "This study examines")
- Avoid colloquialisms and informal language
- Maintain scholarly distance while remaining clear

**Argumentation**
- State thesis clearly in introduction
- Support claims with evidence and citations
- Address counterarguments fairly
- Build arguments logically and systematically

## Citation and Documentation

**Footnote/Endnote Style**
- Follow Chicago Manual of Style (Turabian) or SBL Handbook
- First citation: full bibliographic information
- Subsequent citations: shortened form
- Use "Ibid." for consecutive references to same source

**In-text Citations**
- For academic papers requiring in-text: (Author Year, Page)
- Scripture: (Book Chapter:Verse Translation) e.g., (John 3:16 ESV)
- Classical sources: standard abbreviations

**Bibliography**
- Alphabetical by author's last name
- Proper formatting for books, articles, essays in collections
- Include all works cited in paper
- Distinguish between primary and secondary sources when appropriate

## Language and Style

**Precision in Terminology**
- Use technical theological terms accurately
- Define terms when introducing specialized vocabulary
- Maintain consistency in terminology throughout
- Distinguish between similar concepts (e.g., justification vs. sanctification)

**Sentence Structure**
- Clear, complex sentences acceptable for nuanced arguments
- Avoid unnecessarily convoluted syntax
- Use subordinate clauses for qualification
- Balance complexity with readability

**Paragraph Development**
- Topic sentence stating main idea
- Supporting sentences with evidence and analysis
- Concluding/transitional sentence
- Substantial paragraphs (5-8 sentences typical)

## Biblical and Theological Analysis

**Exegetical Work**
- Engage with original languages when relevant (Greek/Hebrew)
- Consider historical and literary context
- Interact with textual variants if significant
- Apply hermeneutical principles explicitly

**Theological Dialogue**
- Engage with primary sources
- Interact with scholarly consensus and dissent
- Present multiple viewpoints fairly
- Situate argument within broader theological tradition

**Critical Engagement**
- Evaluate sources and arguments
- Identify assumptions and presuppositions
- Acknowledge limitations of evidence
- Distinguish between interpretation and application

## Structure and Organization

**Introduction**
- State research question or thesis
- Provide necessary background
- Preview structure of argument
- Define scope and limitations

**Body**
- Organize by logical sections with clear headings
- Each section advances the overall argument
- Use subheadings for major divisions
- Signal transitions between sections

**Conclusion**
- Summarize main findings
- Restate thesis in light of evidence
- Suggest implications or further research
- Avoid introducing new arguments

## Common Academic Patterns

**Presenting Arguments**
- "This paper/study argues that..."
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "In contrast to X's view, this paper contends..."
- "While scholars generally agree that... there remains debate about..."

**Qualifying Statements**
- "arguably," "presumably," "potentially"
- "It appears that," "The evidence suggests that"
- "This seems to indicate," "One might conclude that"
- Use qualifiers honestly, not to hedge clear evidence

**Engaging Other Scholars**
- "Smith argues that... However, this overlooks..."
- "While Jones correctly notes... his analysis fails to account for..."
- "Building on Brown's insight..."
- "In agreement with Taylor..."

## Avoid

- Emotional appeals without argumentative support
- Proof-texting or oversimplified biblical interpretation
- Dismissing views without fair representation
- Overuse of quotations (synthesize and analyze, don't just compile)
- Assuming reader shares theological presuppositions
- Mixing devotional tone with academic analysis
