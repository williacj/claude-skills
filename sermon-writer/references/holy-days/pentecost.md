## Theological Considerations

### UCG-Specific Emphasis
- Counted 50 days from day after weekly Sabbath during Unleavened Bread (Sunday count)
- Always falls on a Sunday (first day of the week)
- Church is firstfruits, not the only harvest
- Holy Spirit is God's power, not a separate person
- Spirit given to enable obedience and transformation

### Common Misunderstandings to Address
- Holy Spirit is not a third person of the Trinity
- Speaking in tongues at Pentecost was real languages (xenoglossy), not ecstatic utterance
- The Church doesn't replace Israel in God's plan
- Being firstfruits doesn't mean we're superior, but called to serve
- Pentecost wasn't start of the Spirit's work (OT figures had Spirit) but new phase

### Fresh Angles to Consider
- Two wave loaves (representing Jews and Gentiles in the Church)
- Loaves baked with leaven (Church has sin but acceptable through Christ)
- 50 days - significance of the number (jubilee, freedom, release)
- Comparison: Law on stone tablets vs. law written on hearts
- Small spring harvest vs. large fall harvest (timing and size)
- Why God calls some now (firstfruits) vs. later (general harvest)
- The sound of rushing wind and tongues of fire - manifestations of Spirit
- 3,000 baptized vs. 3,000 died at golden calf (grace vs. law without grace)
- Ruth the Moabite gleaning - Gentile grafted in, foreshadowing Church
