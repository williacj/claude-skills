## Holidays NOT Observed (And Why)

### Christmas (December 25)

**UCG Position**: Not observed

**Reasons**:
- Not Christ's actual birthday (likely fall, based on shepherds in fields)
- Date chosen to coincide with pagan winter solstice celebrations (Saturnalia, Sol Invictus)
- No biblical command to celebrate Christ's birth
- Mixed with pagan symbols (evergreen trees, yule logs, mistletoe)
- "Christmas spirit" commercialized and secularized

**If Asked About It**:
- Explain biblically and kindly
- Show pagan origins from history
- Point to God's commanded Holy Days instead
- Don't condemn those who celebrate (educate, don't condemn)
- Focus on truth, not just what we don't do

**Scripture References**:
- Jeremiah 10:2-4 - Don't learn the way of the Gentiles (tree decoration)
- Deuteronomy 12:29-32 - Don't worship God in pagan ways
- Colossians 2:8 - Beware of traditions of men

### Easter (Spring Sunday)

**UCG Position**: Not observed; Passover observed instead

**Reasons**:
- Name derives from pagan goddess Eostre/Ishtar
- Wrong day (moveable Sunday vs. fixed Passover date)
- Replaced biblical Passover and Days of Unleavened Bread
- Mixed with pagan fertility symbols (eggs, rabbits)
- Focus shifted from biblical observance to pagan customs

**If Asked About It**:
- Explain we do celebrate Christ's resurrection (on Passover)
- Show how it replaced God's commanded observances
- Demonstrate pagan origins
- Easter = pagan, Passover = biblical

**Scripture References**:
- 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 - Christ our Passover
- Acts 12:4 - "Easter" should be "Passover" (translation error)

### Halloween (October 31)

**UCG Position**: Not observed

**Reasons**:
- Pagan origins in Celtic Samhain
- Associated with death, occult, darkness
- Glorifies things God condemns (witchcraft, spirits, death)
- Incompatible with Christian values
- "Harvest festival" alternatives still compromise

**If Asked About It**:
- Clear about incompatibility with Christianity

**Scripture References**:
- Ephesians 5:11 - No fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness
