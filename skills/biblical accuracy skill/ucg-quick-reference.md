# UCG Biblical Accuracy - Quick Reference Card

## What Gets Flagged as CRITICAL ERROR

### ❌ Trinity Doctrine
- Teaching three co-equal persons
- Calling Holy Spirit a "person" or "third person"
- Use instead: Father supreme, Son divine (subordinate in role), Spirit is God's power

### ❌ Sunday Worship
- Promoting Sunday as worship day
- Dismissing Sabbath as "Jewish only"
- Use instead: Seventh-day Sabbath commanded in Ten Commandments

### ❌ Dismissing Holy Days
- Calling biblical feasts "Jewish" or obsolete
- Teaching they were abolished
- Use instead: God's appointed times with prophetic meaning (Lev 23)

### ❌ Immortal Soul Doctrine
- Dead go immediately to heaven/hell
- Soul survives death
- Use instead: Dead are unconscious until resurrection (Eccl 9:5)

### ❌ Eternal Torment
- Hell as eternal torture
- Use instead: Annihilation - second death (Rev 20:14, Mal 4:1-3)

### ❌ All Foods Clean
- Teaching dietary laws abolished
- Use instead: Clean/unclean distinctions remain (Lev 11)

## UCG Core Doctrines to Affirm

### ✅ Nature of God
- **God the Father**: Supreme being (1 Cor 8:6)
- **Jesus Christ**: Divine Son, subordinate in role (John 14:28)
- **Holy Spirit**: God's power, not a person (Acts 1:8)

### ✅ Worship & Observances
- **Sabbath**: Saturday (seventh day), creation ordinance
- **Holy Days**: Passover, Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles, Last Great Day
- **Dietary Laws**: Clean and unclean foods still apply

### ✅ Salvation & Future
- **Salvation**: By grace through faith, not works (Eph 2:8-9)
- **Law & Grace**: Work together, not opposed
- **Resurrection**: Bodily resurrection at Christ's return
- **State of Dead**: Unconscious until resurrection
- **Wicked**: Annihilated (second death), not eternal torment

### ✅ Scripture
- Old and New Testament inspired and authoritative
- Old Testament still valid (not abolished)

## Scripture Quick Reference

### UCG Distinctive Doctrines

**Non-Trinitarian:**
- 1 Cor 8:6 - "One God, the Father"
- John 14:28 - "Father is greater than I"
- Acts 1:8 - Holy Spirit = power

**Sabbath:**
- Gen 2:2-3 - Creation ordinance
- Ex 20:8-11 - Fourth Commandment
- Mark 2:27 - Made for man

**Holy Days:**
- Lev 23 - God's appointed feasts
- Col 2:16-17 - Shadow of things to come
- Zech 14:16 - Nations keep Tabernacles

**State of Dead:**
- Eccl 9:5 - Dead know nothing
- 1 Thess 4:13-16 - Resurrection hope

**Annihilation:**
- Mal 4:1-3 - Burned to ashes
- Rev 20:14 - Second death

**Dietary Laws:**
- Lev 11 - Clean and unclean
- Acts 10:28 - Vision about people, not food

---

## Law & Grace Balance (UCG Emphasis)

**Wrong Approaches:**
- Law without grace = Legalism
- Grace without law = Lawlessness

**UCG Approach:**
1. We fall short (Rom 3:23)
2. Forgiveness through Christ's grace (Eph 2:8-9)
3. Love motivates obedience to God's law (John 14:15)
4. Law shows how to live; grace empowers obedience

**Pattern**: Fall short → Forgiveness → Love → Obedience

## Common Misinterpretations to Flag

### "We're not under law" (Rom 6:14)
- ❌ Wrong: Law is abolished
- ✅ Right: Not under law's condemnation, empowered to obey

### "All foods clean" (Mark 7:19)
- ❌ Wrong: Dietary laws ended
- ✅ Right: Context is hand-washing tradition, not food laws

### "Lord's Day" (Rev 1:10)
- ❌ Wrong: Refers to Sunday
- ✅ Right: Day of the Lord (future judgment day) or Sabbath

### "Shadow of things to come" (Col 2:16-17)
- ❌ Wrong: Holy Days are obsolete shadows
- ✅ Right: Future tense - still pointing forward prophetically

## Priority Check Order

When reviewing content, check in this order:

1. **Scripture accuracy** - Are references correct?
2. **Nature of God** - Trinity or UCG view?
3. **Sabbath/Holy Days** - Saturday or Sunday? Feasts affirmed?
4. **Death/Hell** - Immortal soul or unconscious? Torment or annihilation?
5. **Dietary laws** - Valid or abolished?
6. **Law & Grace** - Balanced or opposed?
7. **Context** - Verses in proper context?
8. **Language** - Greek/Hebrew correctly analyzed?

## Remember

The skill now enforces **UCG theology**, not generic "orthodox Christianity."

What mainstream Christianity calls "orthodox" (Trinity, Sunday worship, immortal soul), UCG rejects.

What mainstream Christianity calls "heresy" (non-Trinitarianism), UCG affirms.

The skill is calibrated to UCG doctrinal standards.
