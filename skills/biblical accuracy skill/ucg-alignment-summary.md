# UCG Alignment - Biblical Accuracy Skill

## Summary of Changes

The biblical-accuracy skill has been completely aligned with United Church of God theology, replacing generic "orthodox Christianity" standards with UCG-specific doctrinal positions.

## Major Theological Changes

### 1. Nature of God (CRITICAL CHANGE)

**Before (Trinitarian):**
- Trinity: One God in three co-equal persons
- Holy Spirit as third person of Trinity
- Flagged denial of Trinity as CRITICAL heresy

**After (UCG - Non-Trinitarian):**
- **God the Father**: Supreme being, ultimate authority
- **Jesus Christ**: Divine Son, fully God and fully man, subordinate to Father in role
- **Holy Spirit**: God's power and presence, NOT a separate person
- Flagged Trinity teaching as CRITICAL error
- Flagged treating Holy Spirit as person as CRITICAL error

**Scripture Basis:**
- 1 Corinthians 8:6 - "One God, the Father"
- John 14:28 - "My Father is greater than I"
- 1 Timothy 2:5 - "One God and one Mediator"
- Acts 1:8 - Holy Spirit = "power"
- Luke 1:35 - "Holy Spirit" parallel to "power of the Most High"

### 2. Sabbath Observance (NEW REQUIREMENT)

**Added as Core Doctrine:**
- Seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) is commanded day of worship
- Part of Ten Commandments (moral law)
- Creation ordinance (before Jews existed)

**Flags as CRITICAL:**

- Dismissing Sabbath as "Jewish only"
- Teaching Sabbath was abolished

**Scripture Basis:**
- Genesis 2:2-3 - Sabbath at creation
- Exodus 20:8-11 - Fourth Commandment

### 3. Biblical Holy Days (NEW REQUIREMENT)

**Added as Core Doctrine:**
- Seven annual festivals commanded in Leviticus 23
- Not "Jewish" but "feasts of the LORD"
- Prophetic significance (picture God's plan)
- Never abolished in New Testament

**The Seven Feasts:**
1. Passover - Christ's sacrifice
2. Unleavened Bread - Coming out of sin
3. Pentecost - Church/firstfruits
4. Trumpets - Christ's return
5. Atonement - Satan bound
6. Tabernacles - Millennial reign
7. Last Great Day - Final judgment

**Flags as CRITICAL:**
- Dismissing Holy Days as unnecessary

### 5. Annihilation of Wicked (NEW DOCTRINE)

**Added as Core Doctrine:**
- Wicked are permanently destroyed (second death)
- Not eternal torture
- Lake of fire = permanent destruction, not ongoing torment

**Flags as CRITICAL:**
- Teaching eternal torment
- Describing hell as eternal torture

**Scripture Basis:**
- Malachi 4:1-3 - Wicked burned to ashes
- Matthew 10:28 - God can destroy soul and body

- Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 still apply

9. **Teaches eternal torment** (not annihilation)
10. Major scripture misquotes
11. Original language errors that fundamentally alter meaning

### HIGH Errors (Needs Correction)
1. Scripture reference errors
2. Greek/Hebrew words misidentified
3. Context ignored or misleading
4. Doctrinal imprecision on UCG beliefs
5. Law without grace or grace without law
6. Undermines Old Testament authority

### MEDIUM Errors (Should Be Improved)

## Key Distinctions: UCG vs. Mainstream Christianity

| Doctrine | Mainstream Christianity | UCG Position |
|----------|------------------------|--------------|
| **God's Nature** | Trinity (three persons) | Father supreme, Son divine but subordinate, Spirit is power |
| **Holy Spirit** | Third person of Trinity | God's power, not a person |
| **Worship Day** | Sunday | Seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) |
| **Holy Days** | Christmas, Easter | Biblical feasts (Lev 23) |
| **Dietary Laws** | Abolished | Still valid |
| **State of Dead** | Immortal soul, immediate heaven/hell | Unconscious until resurrection |
| **Hell** | Eternal torment | Annihilation (second death) |
| **Law & Grace** | Often opposed | Work together |

- Reference files loaded as needed
- Examples.md loaded when similar patterns detected
- Greek/Hebrew analysis when doing word studies

## Testing Recommendations

Test the updated skill with content that:
1. **Teaches Trinity** - Should flag as CRITICAL
2. **Dismisses Sabbath** - Should flag as CRITICAL
3. **Calls Holy Days "Jewish"** - Should flag as CRITICAL
4. **Teaches immortal soul** - Should flag as CRITICAL
