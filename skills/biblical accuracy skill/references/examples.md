# Biblical Accuracy Review Examples

Concrete examples of common errors and how to address them.

## Scripture Reference Errors

### Example 1: Verse Conflation

**Content**: "As Paul says in Romans 3:23, 'All have sinned and been justified freely by his grace.'"

**Analysis**:
- Romans 3:23 says: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"
- Romans 3:24 says: "and are justified by his grace as a gift"
- Content conflates two verses into one
- This changes the structure of Paul's argument

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: Cite as Romans 3:23-24 or keep verses separate: "Romans 3:23 tells us all have sinned and fall short of God's glory. Verse 24 then explains that we are justified by his grace as a gift."

**Why It Matters**: Merging verses can obscure the logical flow of the argument and make it harder for readers to verify the source.

---

### Example 2: Wrong Verse Citation

**Content**: "John 3:16 says, 'You must be born again to enter the kingdom of God.'"

**Analysis**:
- John 3:16 is about God's love and giving his Son
- John 3:3 and 3:7 discuss being born again
- Wrong verse cited for the content

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: Change citation to John 3:3 or 3:7

**Why It Matters**: Incorrect citations undermine credibility and prevent readers from finding the actual passage.

## Original Language Errors

### Example 3: Greek Word Misidentification

**Content**: "The Greek word 'dunamis' in Acts 1:8 means 'dynamite power,' showing God's explosive force."

**Analysis**:
- Greek: "δύναμις" (dunamis) = power, strength, ability, capability
- English "dynamite" comes from Greek dunamis, but the reverse isn't true
- Ancient Greek had no concept of explosives (dynamite invented 1867 by Nobel)
- This is anachronistic interpretation - reading modern meanings back into ancient text
- The English etymology fallacy

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: "Dunamis means inherent power and ability, the capacity to accomplish something. The Holy Spirit provides supernatural power and capability for effective witness."

**Why It Matters**: Anachronistic word studies distort the original meaning and can lead to sensationalized interpretations.

---

### Example 4: Hebrew Root Fallacy

**Content**: "Sabbath means 'rest,' so on the Sabbath we must be completely inactive and do nothing."

**Analysis**:
- Root: ש-ב-ת (sh-b-t) in Qal stem = cease, rest
- In Hiphil stem = cause to cease, put an end to
- Genesis 2:2: God שָׁבַת (shabat) - ceased/rested from his work
- Exodus 5:5: Pharaoh makes Israel שָׁבַת (shabat) - cease their work
- Primary meaning is "cease" not necessarily "do nothing"
- The command is to cease regular work, not all activity

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: "Sabbath (שַׁבָּת) comes from a root meaning 'to cease' or 'to stop.' The command is to cease from regular work and labor, making it a day set apart for rest, worship, and focus on God - not total inactivity."

**Why It Matters**: The root fallacy (assuming etymology determines meaning) can lead to legalistic or incorrect applications.

---

### Example 5: Love Word Confusion

**Content**: "The Greek word for love in John 3:16 is 'phileo,' meaning brotherly affection, showing God's friendly love toward us."

**Analysis**:
- The actual Greek word in John 3:16 is "ἠγάπησεν" (ēgapēsen), from ἀγαπάω (agapaō)
- This is ἀγάπη (agapē) love, not φιλέω (phileō) love
- Agape = sacrificial, unconditional, covenant love
- Phileo = brotherly affection, friendship love
- This completely misidentifies the type of love God has

**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Recommendation**: "The Greek word is ἀγαπάω (agapaō), indicating God's sacrificial, unconditional love - the kind of love that seeks the highest good of another regardless of cost. This is the most profound kind of love in Greek, describing God's self-giving nature."

**Why It Matters**: This error fundamentally changes our understanding of God's love and the gospel message. It reduces God's love from sacrificial to merely friendly.

---

## Context Violations

### Example 6: Prosperity Gospel Misuse

**Content**: "Jeremiah 29:11 promises that if we follow God, we'll have a wonderful life with no problems. God has amazing plans for your financial success!"

**Analysis**:
- **Context**: Written to Jews in Babylonian exile
- **Audience**: Corporate (nation of Israel), not primarily individual
- **Timeline**: Promise includes 70 years of exile before restoration (Jer 29:10)
- **Content**: "Plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope"
- **Reality**: Promise includes much suffering before the hopeful future
- **Error**: Eisegesis - reading modern prosperity gospel into ancient text
- **Ignores**: Verses 4-9 command them to settle in Babylon, build houses, plant gardens, marry - they're staying for a long time

**Severity**: HIGH

**Recommendation**: "Jeremiah 29:11 was written to exiles who would spend 70 years in Babylon before seeing restoration. While it shows that God's ultimate plans for his people are good, it doesn't promise immediate prosperity or a problem-free life. The context includes much suffering and waiting before God's good plans unfold. This verse teaches that even in suffering, God has not abandoned his purposes."

**Why It Matters**: Taking this verse out of context creates false expectations, teaches prosperity theology, and ignores the suffering and perseverance that often comes with following God.

---

### Example 7: Ignoring Literary Context

**Content**: "Psalm 137:9 shows that God approves of killing children, saying 'Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!'"

**Analysis**:
- **Genre**: Imprecatory psalm (calling for judgment on enemies)
- **Context**: Exiles in Babylon remembering Jerusalem's destruction
- **Speaker**: Human psalmist, not God speaking directly
- **Type**: Description of desire for justice/vengeance, not prescription
- **Literary device**: Hyperbolic expression of anguish and desire for God's justice
- **Not endorsement**: Recording human emotion and cry for justice, not God's command
- **Canonical context**: Must be read alongside NT teaching (Matt 5:44 - love your enemies)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (if used prescriptively)

**Recommendation**: "Psalm 137:9 is part of an imprecatory psalm expressing the raw anguish and desire for justice from exiles who witnessed terrible atrocities. It records honest human emotion and calls for God to judge Babylon as they judged Israel (lex talionis - measure for measure). This is descriptive poetry expressing pain, not a prescriptive command. It must be understood in light of the whole biblical witness, including Christ's teaching to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us."

**Why It Matters**: Misunderstanding genre and context can make God appear to command evil, when the passage is actually human poetry expressing anguish and calling for divine justice.

## Theological Errors

### Example 8: Works-Based Salvation

**Content**: "We maintain our salvation by living righteously and obeying God's commands. If we stop obeying, we lose our salvation."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: Sola Fide (salvation by faith alone) - Ephesians 2:8-9
- **Confuses**: Justification (declared righteous) with sanctification (being made holy)
- **Contradicts**: Romans 3:28, Romans 4:5, Galatians 2:16, Titus 3:5
- **Problem**: Makes salvation dependent on human effort, not God's grace
- **Misunderstands**: Role of obedience (fruit/evidence, not root/cause)

**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Recommendation**: "We are saved by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). While good works naturally flow from genuine faith (James 2:17), they are the evidence of salvation, not the cause of it. Our obedience is the fruit of salvation, not its root. Romans 8:38-39 assures us that nothing can separate us from God's love. Sanctification (growing in holiness) is the process after justification (being declared righteous), but neither earns nor maintains our salvation."

**Why It Matters**: Teaching works-based salvation denies the gospel and places believers under a burden of performance, destroying assurance and trust in God's grace.

### Example 9: Denying Deity of Christ

**Content**: "Jesus was a great prophet and teacher, chosen by God for a special mission, but he never claimed to be God himself."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: Core orthodox doctrine of Christ's deity
- **Ignores**: Multiple direct claims to deity:
  - John 8:58 - "Before Abraham was, I AM" (YHWH claim)
  - John 10:30 - "I and the Father are one"
  - John 20:28 - Thomas worships Jesus as "My Lord and my God"
- **Misses**: Indirect claims: 
  - Forgives sins (only God can - Mark 2:5-7)
  - Accepts worship (only God should receive - Matt 14:33)
  - Claims authority over Sabbath (Lord of Sabbath - Mark 2:28)
- **Contradicts**: Colossians 2:9, Philippians 2:6, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:3

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Heresy)

**Recommendation**: "Jesus explicitly claimed to be God. In John 8:58, he said 'Before Abraham was, I AM,' using the divine name YHWH and claiming eternal pre-existence. When Thomas called him 'My Lord and my God' (John 20:28), Jesus accepted this worship. Colossians 2:9 states 'the fullness of deity dwells in him bodily.' Denying Christ's deity contradicts core Christian orthodoxy and the clear teaching of Scripture. This is one of the non-negotiable doctrines of the Christian faith."

**Why It Matters**: Christ's deity is essential to Christianity. If Jesus is not God, he cannot save us. This is the difference between orthodox Christianity and heresy (Arianism, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.).

### Example 10: Teaching Trinity Doctrine (UCG Rejects This)

**Content**: "God exists as three co-equal, co-eternal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are distinct persons but one God, equal in power and glory. The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: UCG theology on nature of God
- **Scripture issues**:
  - 1 Corinthians 8:6 - "Yet for us there is one God, the Father"
  - John 14:28 - "My Father is greater than I" (not co-equal)
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 - "One God and one Mediator" (two beings, not three)
  - Acts 2:17 - Spirit "poured out" (impersonal imagery, not a person)
  - Luke 1:35 - "Power of the Most High" parallel to Holy Spirit
- **Problem**: Trinity formulated in 4th century councils, not apostolic teaching
- **Holy Spirit language**: Consistently impersonal (poured, fallen upon, breathed, like wind)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Contradicts UCG core doctrine)

**Recommendation**: "The Bible reveals God the Father as the supreme being (1 Cor 8:6, John 17:3) and Jesus Christ as His divine Son (John 1:1). While Christ is fully God, He is functionally subordinate to the Father (John 14:28, 1 Cor 15:28, Phil 2:6-8). The Holy Spirit is God's power and presence working in believers (Acts 1:8, Luke 1:35), not a separate person. Scripture uses impersonal language for the Spirit—poured out, fallen upon, breathed. The Trinity doctrine of three co-equal persons developed centuries after the apostles through church councils, not from Scripture."

**Why It Matters**: UCG is non-Trinitarian. Teaching Trinity doctrine contradicts UCG's fundamental understanding of God's nature. The Father is supreme, Christ is divine but subordinate in role, and the Holy Spirit is God's power—not a third person. This affects how we pray, worship, and understand our relationship with God.

## Hermeneutical Errors

### Example 11: Allegorizing Without Warrant

**Content**: "The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches that Jesus is the innkeeper (providing rest), believers are the oil and wine (ministering), and the donkey represents the church carrying wounded souls."

**Analysis**:
- **Error**: Allegorizing beyond the text's intent
- **Problem**: Reading meanings into details that Jesus didn't specify
- **Context**: Jesus told this parable to answer "Who is my neighbor?" (Luke 10:29)
- **Jesus' point**: Show mercy to anyone in need, even across ethnic/religious boundaries
- **Eisegesis**: Reading elaborate symbolism into the text without textual warrant
- **Missing**: The actual shocking point - the Samaritan (despised outsider) was the hero

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: "The parable of the Good Samaritan answers the question 'Who is my neighbor?' Jesus' shocking point was that the Samaritan - a despised outsider - showed true love while religious leaders passed by. The lesson is to show mercy to anyone in need, crossing social and ethnic boundaries. While some see Christ-symbolism in the Samaritan, the primary interpretation should stick to what Jesus explicitly taught: go and do likewise - show mercy."

**Why It Matters**: Over-allegorizing obscures the actual teaching and turns parables into mystical puzzles rather than clear moral lessons.

---

### Example 12: Genre Confusion

**Content**: "Song of Solomon 4:5 proves that God wants women to have a specific body type: 'Your two breasts are like two fawns.'"

**Analysis**:
- **Genre**: Love poetry, not doctrinal prescription
- **Context**: Man praising his beloved's beauty
- **Literary device**: Metaphor and simile (not literal comparison)
- **Error**: Treating poetry as literal instruction
- **Misses**: Cultural context of beauty standards
- **Problem**: Turns poetry into theology, creates harmful body image issues

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Recommendation**: "Song of Solomon is poetic love literature celebrating marital intimacy. This verse uses metaphor and simile common to ancient Near Eastern love poetry. It's not prescriptive (defining ideal body types) but descriptive (a man praising his wife's beauty). Reading it literally misunderstands the genre and inappropriately turns poetry into doctrine about body standards."

**Why It Matters**: Confusing poetry with prescription can create legalism, harm, and miss the actual purpose of the text (celebrating marital love).

## UCG-Specific Doctrinal Examples

### Example 13: Dismissing Sabbath Observance

**Content**: "The Sabbath was just for the Jews. Christians worship on Sunday because Jesus rose on the first day of the week. We're not under the law anymore."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: UCG core doctrine on Sabbath observance
- **Scripture issues**:
  - Genesis 2:2-3 - Sabbath established at creation (before Jews existed)
  - Exodus 20:8-11 - Fourth Commandment (part of moral law)
  - Mark 2:27 - "Sabbath was made for man" (all humanity, not just Jews)
  - Hebrews 4:9 - "There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God"
  - No Scripture changes Sabbath to Sunday
- **Historical fact**: Sunday worship arose through church tradition (2nd-3rd century), not apostolic practice
- **Acts shows**: Early church kept Sabbath (Acts 13:14, 42, 44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Contradicts UCG distinctive doctrine)

**Recommendation**: "The Sabbath was established at creation before any Jews existed (Gen 2:2-3) and is part of the Ten Commandments (Ex 20:8-11). Jesus kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16) and said He is 'Lord of the Sabbath' (Mark 2:28), affirming its ongoing significance. The apostles continued keeping Sabbath (Acts 13:42-44, 17:2, 18:4). No Scripture authorizes a change to Sunday—this came through later church tradition. Being 'not under the law' (Rom 6:14) means not under its condemnation, not that the law is abolished. Jesus said He came to fulfill the law, not abolish it (Matt 5:17)."

**Why It Matters**: Sabbath observance is a core UCG distinctive and a sign of covenant relationship with God. Dismissing it as "Jewish" ignores its creation origin and New Testament affirmation.

### Example 14: Teaching Immortal Soul Doctrine

**Content**: "When you die, your soul goes immediately to heaven to be with Jesus. Your body dies, but the real you—your immortal soul—lives on forever in God's presence."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: UCG doctrine on state of the dead
- **Scripture contradicts this**:
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5 - "The dead know nothing"
  - Psalm 146:4 - "His breath departs...his thoughts perish"
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 - Resurrection at Christ's return (why if already in heaven?)
  - John 11:11-14 - Lazarus "sleeps" until Jesus raises him
  - 1 Corinthians 15 - Entire chapter about importance of resurrection
- **Problem**: "Soul" (nephesh/psyche) means "living being," not immortal essence
- **Genesis 2:7** - Man became a living soul (not received a soul)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Contradicts UCG core doctrine)

**Recommendation**: "The Bible teaches that the dead are unconscious, 'asleep,' awaiting resurrection (Eccl 9:5, Psalm 146:4, 1 Thess 4:13-16). When we die, our thoughts perish; we know nothing. The biblical hope is not an immortal soul going to heaven, but the resurrection of the body at Christ's return (1 Cor 15, John 5:28-29). The word 'soul' (nephesh in Hebrew, psyche in Greek) simply means 'living being'—the whole person, not an immortal part that survives death (Gen 2:7). Jesus said Lazarus was 'asleep,' not in heaven (John 11:11-14)."

**Why It Matters**: The immortal soul doctrine is pagan Greek philosophy (Plato), not biblical teaching. It undermines the hope of resurrection and misrepresents what happens at death.

---

### Example 15: Declaring All Foods Clean

**Content**: "Jesus declared all foods clean (Mark 7:19), so Christians can eat anything—pork, shellfish, whatever. The dietary laws were just for ancient Israel."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: UCG doctrine on dietary laws
- **Misreads Mark 7:19**:
  - Context: Washing hands before eating (ceremonial tradition), not what foods to eat
  - "Food" in context means clean food (Jews didn't consider pork "food")
  - Later phrase "declaring all foods clean" is translator's interpretation, not in original
  - Jesus was correcting Pharisees' additions, not God's law
- **Acts 10**: Peter's vision about accepting Gentiles, not declaring unclean animals as food
  - Peter explains: "God has shown me I should not call any **man** common or unclean" (v. 28)
- **Acts 15**: Council assumes dietary laws known; addresses blood and strangled meat

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Contradicts UCG distinctive doctrine)

**Recommendation**: "Mark 7 addresses ceremonial hand-washing traditions, not dietary laws. Jesus was correcting Pharisees' man-made rules, not changing God's commands about clean and unclean animals. Peter's vision in Acts 10 was about accepting Gentiles (verse 28 makes this clear), not declaring all animals as food. The dietary laws in Leviticus 11 pre-date Moses (Noah knew the difference, Gen 7:2) and reflect God's design for health and holiness. Acts 15 assumes these laws are known and binding. No Scripture abolishes the distinction between clean and unclean foods."

**Why It Matters**: Dietary laws are a UCG distinctive doctrine rooted in creation design and health principles. Claiming they're abolished misinterprets key passages and ignores God's ongoing instruction for healthy living.

---

### Example 16: Dismissing Biblical Holy Days

**Content**: "The festivals in Leviticus 23 were Jewish holy days that ended with Christ. Christians don't need to keep Passover or Tabernacles—those were shadows that have passed away."

**Analysis**:
- **Violates**: UCG core doctrine on biblical Holy Days
- **Scripture issues**:
  - Leviticus 23:2 - "Feasts of the LORD" (not "feasts of the Jews")
  - Leviticus 23:14, 21, 31, 41 - "Statute forever throughout your generations"
  - Colossians 2:16-17 - "Shadow of things **to come**" (future tense, still pointing forward)
  - Zechariah 14:16-19 - Nations will keep Feast of Tabernacles in millennium
  - Acts 18:21, 20:6, 20:16 - Paul kept the feasts
  - 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 - "Let us keep the feast" (of Unleavened Bread)
- **Never abolished**: No Scripture ends their observance

**Severity**: CRITICAL (Contradicts UCG distinctive doctrine)

**Recommendation**: "The biblical Holy Days in Leviticus 23 are called 'feasts of the LORD,' not feasts of the Jews (Lev 23:2). God calls them statutes 'forever' (Lev 23:14, 21, 41). They picture God's plan: Passover (Christ's sacrifice), Unleavened Bread (putting out sin), Pentecost (Church), Trumpets (Christ's return), Atonement (Satan bound), Tabernacles (millennium), Last Great Day (final judgment). Colossians 2:16-17 calls them 'shadows of things **to come**'—still pointing forward. The early church kept them (Acts 18:21, 20:6, 1 Cor 5:7-8), and Zechariah 14:16 shows nations keeping Tabernacles in the Kingdom. Nothing in Scripture ends their observance."

**Why It Matters**: The biblical Holy Days are central to UCG theology and practice. They reveal God's plan of salvation and are prophetic. Dismissing them as "Jewish" ignores their ongoing significance and prophetic meaning.

## Summary of Common Error Patterns

1. **Scripture Reference Errors**: Wrong verses, conflated passages, misquotes
2. **Greek/Hebrew Mistakes**: Wrong words, anachronistic meanings, root fallacies
3. **Context Violations**: Ignoring surrounding verses, literary genre, or historical situation
4. **Theological Errors**: Denying core doctrines, works-based salvation, heretical claims
5. **Hermeneutical Failures**: Eisegesis, over-allegorizing, genre confusion, proof-texting

**Key Principle**: Always check the actual text, understand the context, analyze the language carefully, and ensure theological soundness before making claims about what the Bible teaches.
