## Verb System

### Verb Stems (Binyanim)

Hebrew verbs are built on 3-letter roots (שׁ-מ-ר = "guard/keep"). Stems modify the basic meaning:

**Qal** - Simple active
- Basic meaning of the root
- Example: קָטַל (qatal) = "he killed"

**Niphal** - Simple passive or reflexive
- Passive of Qal
- Sometimes reciprocal
- Example: נִקְטַל (niqtal) = "he was killed"

**Piel** - Intensive active
- Intensified or repeated action
- Can indicate causation
- Example: קִטֵּל (qittel) = "he slaughtered" (intensive)

**Pual** - Intensive passive
- Passive of Piel
- Example: קֻטַּל (quttal) = "he was slaughtered"

**Hiphil** - Causative active
- Causes someone else to do the action
- Example: הִקְטִיל (hiqtil) = "he caused to kill"

**Hophal** - Causative passive
- Passive of Hiphil

**Hithpael** - Reflexive/reciprocal
- Subject acts upon itself
- Reciprocal action between parties
- Example: הִתְקַטֵּל (hitqattel) = "he killed himself" or "they killed each other"

### Verb Conjugations (Tense/Aspect)

Hebrew doesn't have "tenses" like Greek. Instead, it has aspects (completed vs. incomplete action):

**Perfect** (קָטַל - qatal)
- Completed action
- Usually past time, but not always
- Can express certainty of future events (prophetic perfect)
- "He killed" / "He has killed"

**Imperfect** (יִקְטֹל - yiqtol)
- Incomplete/ongoing action
- Usually future or habitual
- Can be past in narrative sequences
- "He will kill" / "He was killing"

**Imperative** (קְטֹל - qetol)
- Commands (2nd person only)
- "Kill!"

**Infinitive Construct** (קְטֹל - qetol)
- Most common infinitive
- "To kill"
- Often with prepositions

**Infinitive Absolute** (קָטוֹל - qatol)
- Emphatic or intensive
- Often paired with finite verbs for emphasis
- "He surely killed" / "killing, he killed"

**Participle** (קֹטֵל - qotel)
- Verbal adjective
- Active: "killing" / "one who kills"
- Can function as present tense
- Descriptive or continuous action

### Key Verb Examples

**Genesis 1:1** - בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים
(Bereshit bara Elohim)
"In the beginning, God created"

- בָּרָא (bara) = Qal perfect, 3ms
- Completed action in the past
- Root: ב-ר-א (create - used only of God's creative work)

## Hebrew Word Structure

  - כֹּתֵב (kotev) = writing
  - כְּתָב (ketav) = writing (noun)

## Hebrew Poetry Devices

### Parallelism

**Synonymous Parallelism** - Second line repeats first in different words

> And the sky proclaims the work of his hands

**Antithetic Parallelism** - Second line contrasts with first
Example (Proverbs 10:1):
> A wise son makes a glad father,
> But a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother

**Synthetic Parallelism** - Second line builds on first
Example (Psalm 23:1-2):
> The LORD is my shepherd,
> I shall not want

**Chiastic Parallelism** - A-B-B-A pattern
Example (Psalm 51:1):
> A: Have mercy on me, O God,
>   B: according to your steadfast love;
>   B': according to your abundant mercy
> A': blot out my transgressions

### Wordplay

Hebrew loves puns and sound plays:

**Genesis 2:7** - אָדָם (adam - man) from אֲדָמָה (adamah - ground)
"Man from the ground"

**Isaiah 5:7** - God looked for מִשְׁפָּט (mishpat - justice)
but saw מִשְׂפָּח (mispach - bloodshed)
Expected צְדָקָה (tzedaqah - righteousness)
but heard צְעָקָה (tze'aqah - cry of distress)

**Micah 1:10-15** - Series of place name puns
Example: בֵּית לְעַפְרָה (Bet le-Afrah) = "House of Dust"
בֶּעָפָר הִתְפַּלָּשִׁי (be-afar hitpallashi) = "roll yourself in the dust"

### Acrostic Poems

Some psalms follow the Hebrew alphabet:
- Psalm 119 (longest chapter) - 22 stanzas, one for each letter
- Psalm 145
- Lamentations chapters 1-4

## Common Interpretive Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Verb Stems

**Mistake**: Treating all forms of a root as identical
**Example**: "Sabbath means 'rest' so we must be inactive"
**Truth**: Root ש-ב-ת in Hiphil means "cause to cease" not "rest"
- Genesis 2:2-3: God שָׁבַת (shabat - ceased/rested)
- Exodus 5:5: פרעה makes Israel שָׁבַת (shabat - cease work)

### 2. Word Study Fallacy

**Mistake**: Assuming all uses of a word have the same theological weight
**Example**: "Every time 'holy' appears, it means complete perfection"
**Truth**: קָדוֹשׁ (qadosh) primarily means "set apart," not moral perfection
- Holy objects (bread, vessels) aren't morally perfect
- Holy means consecrated for God's purposes

### 3. English Etymology Reverse-Transfer

**Mistake**: Reading English theological terms back into Hebrew
**Example**: "Satan means 'adversary' so any opponent is Satan"
**Truth**: שָׂטָן (satan) means adversary/accuser but doesn't always refer to the devil
- Numbers 22:22: Angel is Israel's שָׂטָן (opponent)
- 1 Kings 11:14: Human adversary called שָׂטָן

### 4. Ignoring Context

**Mistake**: Atomistic word studies divorced from context
**Example**: "שָׁלוֹם (shalom) appears, so this means spiritual peace with God"
**Truth**: Context determines meaning
- Can mean: peace, safety, welfare, hello, goodbye
- Must check how it's used in the specific passage

### 5. Missing Poetic Devices

**Mistake**: Reading poetry as literal prose
**Example**: Taking Psalm 91:4 literally - God has physical feathers
**Truth**: Hebrew poetry uses metaphor extensively
- Recognize genre: poetry, prophecy, narrative, law
- Don't force literal readings on figurative language

## Practical Analysis Steps

When analyzing a Hebrew word:

1. **Identify the root (שׁוֹרֶשׁ)**
   - Usually 3 consonants
   - Sometimes 2 or 4 letters

2. **Determine the stem (binyan)**
   - Qal, Niphal, Piel, Hiphil, etc.
   - Changes the basic meaning

3. **Check grammatical form**
   - Verb: perfect, imperfect, participle, etc.
   - Noun: gender, number, construct state

4. **Consult lexicons for semantic range**
   - BDB (Brown-Driver-Briggs) - standard OT Hebrew lexicon
   - HALOT (Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the OT)
   - TDOT (Theological Dictionary of the OT)

5. **Examine context**
   - Immediate verse context
   - Chapter/book context
   - Literary genre (poetry, narrative, law, prophecy)

6. **Check parallel passages**
   - Where else is this root used?
   - How do other biblical authors use it?
   - LXX (Septuagint) Greek translation insights

7. **Consider ancient Near Eastern context**
   - Cognates in related languages (Akkadian, Ugaritic, Arabic)
   - Cultural background
   - Historical setting

## Theological Significance Examples

### Genesis 1:1 - בְּרֵאשִׁית

"In the beginning God created..."

- בְּרֵאשִׁית (bereshit) - "in the beginning"
- Not בָּרִאשׁוֹן (ba-rishon) - "at first"
- Emphasizes the absolute beginning, not relative sequence

### Exodus 3:14 - אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה

"I AM WHO I AM"

- אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh) - Qal imperfect, 1st person singular of ה-י-ה (to be)
- Not just existence but active, dynamic presence
- "I will be who I will be" - God determines who He is
- Connected to יְהוָה (YHWH) - "He is" or "He causes to be"

### Isaiah 53:5 - נָגוּעַ מְדֻכָּא

"He was pierced... he was crushed"

- נָגוּעַ (nagua) - Qal passive participle: "pierced through"
- מְדֻכָּא (medukka) - Pual participle: "crushed"
- Both passive forms emphasize what was done to him
- Substitutionary suffering

### Psalm 51:1 - חָנֵּנִי

"Have mercy on me"

- חָנֵּנִי (chonneni) - Qal imperative with suffix: "be gracious to me"
- Root: ח-נ-נ (show favor, be gracious)
- Not just pity but favor to the undeserving
- Related to חֵן (chen - grace)
