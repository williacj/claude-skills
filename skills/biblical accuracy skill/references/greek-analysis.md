**Aorist** (simple/undefined action)

**Perfect** (completed action with ongoing results)

## Common Interpretive Mistakes

### 1. Root Fallacy
**Mistake**: Assuming etymology determines meaning
**Example**: "Ekklesia (church) means 'called out ones' so Christians must separate from the world"
**Truth**: Etymology ≠ current meaning. Ekklesia simply meant "assembly" in Greek

### 2. Illegitimate Totality Transfer
**Mistake**: Loading all possible meanings into one instance
**Example**: "Logos in John 1:1 means word + reason + speech + account..."
**Truth**: Context determines which meaning applies

### 3. One-Meaning Fallacy
**Mistake**: Assuming a Greek word always means the same thing
**Example**: "Kosmos always means 'the world system opposed to God'"
**Truth**: Kosmos can mean: universe, earth, humanity, world system (context matters)

### 4. English Etymology Reverse-Transfer
**Mistake**: Reading English word origins back into Greek
**Example**: "Dunamis means dynamite power!"
**Truth**: Ancient Greek had no explosives; dynamite came from dunamis, not vice versa

### 5. Concordance Abuse
**Mistake**: Using Strong's numbers without understanding Greek
**Example**: "Strong's #25 is agapao, which always means unconditional love"
**Truth**: Strong's is a concordance tool, not a lexicon. Words have ranges of meaning

## Verb Tense Examples in Theology

### Present Tense - Ongoing Action

**John 3:16** - "For God so loved (ἠγάπησεν - aorist) the world that he gave (ἔδωκεν - aorist) his only Son, that whoever believes (πιστεύων - present participle) in him should not perish but have (ἔχῃ - present subjunctive) eternal life."

- Believing is ongoing, continuous action
- Not a one-time decision only, but continuing trust

**1 John 3:9** - "No one who is born (γεγεννημένος - perfect participle) of God practices (ποιεῖ - present) sin"

- Born = perfect tense (past action, ongoing results)
- Practices = present tense (habitual, continuous action)
- Not "never sins" but "doesn't make a practice of sin"

### Aorist Tense - Point Action

**Romans 5:1** - "Therefore, since we have been justified (δικαιωθέντες - aorist participle) by faith..."

- Justification happened at a point in time
- One-time declaration of righteousness
- Not an ongoing process

### Perfect Tense - Completed with Ongoing Results

**John 19:30** - "It is finished (τετέλεσται - perfect indicative)"

- The work is done (completed)
- And it remains finished (ongoing state)
- Not "it was finished" (aorist) but perfect: accomplished and stands accomplished

**Ephesians 2:8** - "For by grace you have been saved (ἐστε σεσῳσμένοι - perfect periphrastic)"

- Saved in the past
- Remain in a state of salvation now
- Not just "you were saved" but "you are having been saved"

## Prepositions Matter

**ἐν (en)** - in, by, with
- Often indicates sphere or means
- "In Christ" = sphere of existence

**εἰς (eis)** - into, to, for
- Motion toward
- "Baptized into Christ" = entering into union

**ἐκ (ek)** - out of, from
- Source or origin
- "Out of faith" = faith as source

**διά (dia)** - through, by means of
- With genitive: through (agency)
- With accusative: because of (cause)
- "Through faith" = means of salvation

**ὑπέρ (huper)** - on behalf of, for
- Substitution
- "Christ died for (ὑπέρ) us" = substitutionary atonement

**ἀντί (anti)** - instead of, in place of
- Exchange
- "Ransom for many" = substitutionary payment

## Practical Analysis Steps

When analyzing a Greek word:

1. **Identify the lexical form (lemma)**
   - Verbs: first person singular present indicative
   - Nouns: nominative singular
   - Adjectives: nominative singular masculine

2. **Determine the grammatical form**
   - Tense, voice, mood (verbs)
   - Case, number, gender (nouns)

3. **Consult lexicons for semantic range**
   - BDAG (Bauer-Danker-Arndt-Gingrich) - best NT Greek lexicon
   - Liddell-Scott-Jones - classical Greek
   - Thayer's - older but free

4. **Check context**
   - How is it used in this sentence?
   - How does this author use it elsewhere?
   - How is it used in the LXX (Septuagint)?

5. **Cross-reference similar passages**
   - How do parallel passages use the word?
   - What's the theological context?

6. **Avoid common fallacies**
   - Don't assume etymology = meaning
   - Don't load all meanings into one usage
   - Don't ignore grammatical function
