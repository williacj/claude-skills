## Usage Notes

When reviewing theological content:

1. **Check against core orthodox doctrines** - Non-negotiable
2. **Allow latitude on secondary issues** - Denominational distinctives
3. **Verify biblical support** - Does Scripture actually teach this?
4. **Check for balance** - Is one truth emphasized at expense of another?
5. **Consider audience** - Is theological language clear for intended readers?

**Remember**: The goal is biblical fidelity and theological soundness, not enforcing one denomination's distinctives over another.
