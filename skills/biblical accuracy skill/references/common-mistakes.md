# Common Interpretive Mistakes

Reference guide for hermeneutical fallacies and mistakes to avoid when interpreting Scripture.

## Linguistic Fallacies

### 1. Root Fallacy

**Description**: Assuming the etymology (root origin) of a word determines its meaning in every context.

**Problem**: Words evolve. Etymology shows history, not current meaning. Modern usage determines meaning, not ancient roots.

**Examples**:
- "Ekklesia (church) means 'called out ones' so Christians must separate from the world"
  - **Reality**: Ekklesia simply meant "assembly" in Greek
  - It was used for town meetings, not religious separatists
  - Etymology doesn't equal meaning

- "Dynamis means dynamite, so God's power is explosive"
  - **Reality**: Ancient Greek had no explosives
  - Dynamite came from dunamis (1867), not vice versa
  - Anachronistic interpretation

**How to Avoid**: Check how the word is actually used in context, not just its historical origin. Consult lexicons for semantic range, not just etymology.

### 2. Illegitimate Totality Transfer

**Description**: Loading all possible meanings of a word into one specific instance.

**Problem**: Words have a range of meanings (semantic domain), but context determines which meaning applies. You can't import all meanings simultaneously.

**Examples**:
- "Logos in John 1:1 means word + reason + speech + account + proportion + logic..."
  - **Reality**: Context (John's prologue) determines the specific meaning
  - Here it means "divine Word/reason" as Christ
  - Not all meanings apply at once

- "Kosmos always means the evil world system opposed to God"
  - **Reality**: Kosmos has multiple meanings depending on context:
    - Universe/creation (Acts 17:24)
    - Earth (John 11:9)
    - Humanity (John 3:16)
    - World system (1 John 2:15)
  - Context determines which meaning

**How to Avoid**: Identify the specific meaning intended in this context. Check parallel uses by the same author.

---

### 3. One-Meaning Fallacy

**Description**: Assuming a Greek or Hebrew word always has the same meaning every time it appears.

**Problem**: Words are flexible. Context determines which shade of meaning applies.

**Examples**:
- "Sarx (flesh) always means 'sinful nature'"
  - **Reality**: Sarx can mean:
    - Physical flesh/body (1 Cor 15:39)
    - Human nature (John 1:14 - Word became flesh)
    - Sinful nature (Rom 8:3-8)
    - Human descent (Rom 1:3)
  - Context determines meaning

**How to Avoid**: Check the semantic range and see how it's used in different contexts.

---

### 4. English Etymology Reverse-Transfer

**Description**: Reading English word origins back into the original Greek or Hebrew.

**Problem**: Greek/Hebrew came first, then English. Modern English doesn't define ancient languages.

**Examples**:
- "Sincere comes from 'sine cera' (without wax), so biblical sincerity means..."
  - **Reality**: This Latin etymology is disputed and doesn't define Greek εἰλικρινής (eilikrinēs)
  - The Greek word has its own meaning independent of Latin or English

- "Enthusiasm means 'en theos' (in God), so..."
  - **Reality**: While true, modern English meaning has drifted far from Greek etymology
  - Can't define ancient Greek by modern English etymology

**How to Avoid**: Start with the original language, not English etymology. Check how the actual Greek or Hebrew word was used.

---

### 5. Concordance Abuse

**Description**: Using Strong's Concordance numbers or basic lexicons without understanding linguistic nuances.

**Problem**: Strong's is a concordance (word index), not a proper lexicon. It oversimplifies complex words.

**Examples**:
- "Strong's #25 is agapaō, which means unconditional love"
  - **Reality**: Words don't have a single definition
  - Agapaō can mean various types of love depending on context
  - Need proper lexicons (BDAG, HALOT) not just Strong's

**How to Avoid**: Use proper lexicons (BDAG for Greek, BDB/HALOT for Hebrew). Understand that words have semantic ranges, not single definitions.

---

## Contextual Fallacies

### 6. Proof-Texting

**Description**: Using isolated Bible verses to support a position without considering context.

**Problem**: Verses aren't meant to stand alone. They're part of larger arguments and narratives.

**Examples**:
- "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Phil 4:13)
  - **Used as**: Motivational quote for success
  - **Actual context**: Paul discussing contentment in any circumstance, whether in need or abundance
  - Not about achieving athletic goals or business success

- "Judge not, that you be not judged" (Matt 7:1)
  - **Used as**: Never make any moral judgments
  - **Actual context**: Don't be hypocritical; remove your own sin before judging others (vv. 3-5)
  - Not prohibiting all discernment

**How to Avoid**: Always read verses in context. Ask: What comes before and after? What's the author's main point?

---

### 7. Ignoring Literary Genre

**Description**: Reading all biblical texts the same way, without considering genre differences.

**Problem**: Poetry isn't prose. Narrative isn't law. Wisdom literature isn't history. Genre affects interpretation.

**Examples**:
- Reading Revelation as straightforward chronological history
  - **Reality**: Apocalyptic literature uses symbols and isn't strictly chronological
  
- Taking Job's friends' speeches as God's endorsed teaching
  - **Reality**: God rebukes Job's friends at the end (Job 42:7)
  - Not everything in the Bible is endorsed by God

- Reading Psalms as literal descriptions
  - **Reality**: Poetry uses metaphor and hyperbole
  - "God has feathers" (Ps 91:4) is metaphor, not literal

**How to Avoid**: Identify the genre (law, history, poetry, prophecy, wisdom, gospel, epistle, apocalyptic). Interpret according to genre conventions.

---

### 8. Chronological Snobbery

**Description**: Dismissing historical interpretation in favor of novel modern readings.

**Problem**: If no one in 2,000 years saw this meaning, maybe it's not there.

**Examples**:
- "The Bible predicted quantum physics in Hebrews 11:3"
  - **Reality**: The passage discusses God creating by his word, not subatomic particles
  - Reading modern science back into ancient text

**How to Avoid**: Check how the church historically interpreted this passage. Novel interpretations require strong justification.

---

### 9. Selective Literalism

**Description**: Reading some passages literally and others figuratively based on preference rather than context.

**Problem**: Inconsistent hermeneutic picks and chooses based on desired outcome.

**Examples**:
- "Love your neighbor" (metaphorical - means general kindness)
- But "God will make you wealthy" (literal - actual financial prosperity)
- **Reality**: Should be reversed based on genre and context

**How to Avoid**: Let the text's genre, context, and language determine literalness, not personal preference.

---

## Theological Fallacies

### 10. Abandoning Analogia Fidei

**Description**: Interpreting a verse in a way that contradicts clear biblical teaching elsewhere.

**Problem**: Scripture interprets Scripture. Unclear passages should align with clear ones.

**Examples**:
- Interpreting "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26) to mean works save us
  - **Violates**: Clear teaching that salvation is by grace through faith (Eph 2:8-9)
  - **Solution**: James discusses evidence of faith, not cause of salvation

**How to Avoid**: Check if your interpretation contradicts clearer biblical teaching. Scripture doesn't contradict itself.

---

### 11. Eisegesis Instead of Exegesis

**Description**: Reading your ideas into the text (eisegesis) rather than drawing meaning from the text (exegesis).

**Problem**: Makes the Bible say what you want instead of what God said.

**Examples**:
- "This verse confirms my political view / economic theory / life philosophy"
  - **Reality**: Often forcing modern concepts onto ancient text

**How to Avoid**: Ask "What did this mean to the original audience?" before "What does this mean to me?" Apply after you've interpreted.

---

### 12. Mystical/Secret Meanings

**Description**: Finding hidden codes, numerology, or secret meanings not evident in the text.

**Problem**: Adds to Scripture. Makes interpretation subjective and unverifiable.

**Examples**:
- Number codes and gematria
- "God told me this verse means..."
- Seeing Jesus in every minor OT detail

**How to Avoid**: Stick to the plain meaning. Typology is valid (OT types fulfilled in Christ), but not every detail is symbolic.

---

## Cultural/Historical Fallacies

### 13. Cultural Imperialism

**Description**: Reading modern Western culture into ancient Near Eastern or Greco-Roman contexts.

**Problem**: Projects modern assumptions onto ancient texts.

**Examples**:
- Assuming biblical "slavery" equals American chattel slavery
  - **Reality**: Different institutions; ancient Near Eastern slavery included debt servitude, not race-based chattel slavery

- Reading American individualism into corporate ancient cultures
  - **Reality**: Ancient cultures were more communal/corporate

**How to Avoid**: Study historical and cultural background. Ask what this meant in their culture.

---

### 14. Dispensational Confusion

**Description**: Not recognizing progressive revelation and covenant transitions.

**Problem**: Ignores that God revealed truth progressively and that covenants change.

**Examples**:
- Christians must follow OT dietary laws
  - **Reality**: Fulfilled in Christ (Mark 7:19, Acts 10, Col 2:16-17)

- OT Israel and Church are identical
  - **Reality**: Continuity and discontinuity; not simple equation

**How to Avoid**: Recognize old covenant vs. new covenant. Christ fulfills OT law and types.

---

## Practical Application Fallacies

### 15. Straight-Line Application

**Description**: Applying ancient texts directly to modern situations without considering differences.

**Problem**: Ignores cultural, historical, and covenant differences.

**Examples**:
- "Biblical head coverings command applies exactly the same today"
  - **Reality**: Need to discern cultural expressions vs. timeless principles
  - Principle: modesty and respecting worship
  - Expression: may vary by culture

**How to Avoid**: Distinguish between timeless principles and cultural expressions. Ask what transcultural principle underlies the specific command.

---

### 16. Flattening Differences Between Testaments

**Description**: Not recognizing the OT shadows pointing to NT fulfillment.

**Problem**: Misses Christ as the interpretive key to Scripture.

**Examples**:
- Applying OT theocratic civil law directly to modern nations
  - **Reality**: Israel was unique; OT civil law was for that specific covenant nation
  - NT church is not a political nation

**How to Avoid**: Recognize OT as pointing forward to Christ. Understand typology and fulfillment.

## Summary: Keys to Avoiding Mistakes

### Do:
1. **Read in context** - Verses, chapters, whole books
2. **Identify genre** - Poetry, law, narrative, epistle, etc.
3. **Study grammar** - Verb tenses, moods, cases matter
4. **Check historical/cultural background** - What did it mean then?
5. **Compare Scripture with Scripture** - Let clear passages interpret unclear
6. **Consult reliable sources** - Lexicons, commentaries, scholars
7. **Apply grammatical-historical method** - What did it mean in its original setting?
8. **Recognize progressive revelation** - OT points to NT
9. **Distinguish principle from cultural expression** - What's timeless vs. temporary?
10. **Stay humble** - Acknowledge limitations and scholarly debates

### Don't:
1. Proof-text without context
2. Assume etymology = meaning
3. Load all word meanings into one usage
4. Read modern ideas back into ancient texts
5. Ignore literary genre
6. Dismiss 2,000 years of interpretation without cause
7. Make the Bible say what you want (eisegesis)
8. Find secret codes or hidden meanings
9. Ignore cultural and historical background
10. Apply OT law directly without considering Christ's fulfillment

### The Golden Rule of Interpretation:

**"What did this mean to the original audience before it means anything to me?"**

Answer that first, then apply to today's context, recognizing both continuity and discontinuity between then and now.
