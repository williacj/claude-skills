# Biblical Accuracy Skill - Usage Guide

## Overview

This skill enables deep biblical accuracy checking with original language analysis (Greek and Hebrew). It goes far beyond simple scripture reference verification to ensure theological soundness and linguistic fidelity to the original biblical texts.

## What This Skill Does

### Core Capabilities

1. **Scripture Verification** - Validates all biblical references and quotations for accuracy
2. **Contextual Analysis** - Ensures verses aren't taken out of context
3. **Original Language Analysis** - Deep linguistic analysis of Greek and Hebrew texts
4. **Theological Soundness** - Checks alignment with orthodox Christian theology
5. **Hermeneutical Integrity** - Verifies valid interpretation methods

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

Simply ask Claude to check your biblical content for accuracy:

```
"Please check this sermon for biblical accuracy"
"Verify the scripture references in this devotional"
"Review this teaching for theological soundness"
"Check if I'm using these Greek words correctly"
```

### Advanced Usage

For deep linguistic analysis, be specific:

```
"Analyze the Greek words in this paragraph about love"
"Check the Hebrew verb stems in my Old Testament interpretation"
"Verify this word study on 'faith' using the original languages"
"Does my interpretation align with the grammatical-historical method?"
```

## What Gets Checked

### Scripture References
- Correct book, chapter, and verse citations
- Accurate quotations matching biblical text
- Proper translation attribution

### Context
- Surrounding verses support the interpretation
- Literary context considered (poetry, narrative, epistle)
- Author's intent and original audience

### Original Languages

**Greek Analysis:**
- Verb tenses (aorist, perfect, present, etc.)
- Voice (active, passive, middle)
- Mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative)
- Case systems for nouns
- Lexical ranges and theological significance

**Hebrew Analysis:**
- Verb stems (Qal, Niphal, Piel, Hiphil, etc.)
- Root meanings and word patterns
- Poetic devices (parallelism, wordplay)
- Covenant terminology and theological concepts

### Theological Soundness

**Core Doctrines (Always Enforced):**
- Trinity
- Deity of Christ
- Salvation by grace through faith
- Bodily resurrection
- Authority of Scripture
- Second coming

**Secondary Issues (Latitude Given):**
- Baptism mode
- Church government
- End times views
- Spiritual gifts debates

## Severity Levels

**CRITICAL** - Stop immediately
- Heretical teaching
- Major scripture errors changing meaning
- Fundamental misuse of original languages

**HIGH** - Needs correction before use
- Scripture reference errors
- Greek/Hebrew words misidentified
- Context significantly ignored

**MEDIUM** - Should be improved
- Minor translation variations
- Incomplete context
- Theological imprecision

**LOW** - Enhancement suggestions
- Additional cross-references
- Alternate translations
- Minor clarifications

## Reference Files

The skill includes five detailed reference files for deep analysis:

1. **greek-analysis.md** (12KB) - Greek linguistic patterns, verb systems, common theological terms
2. **hebrew-analysis.md** (15KB) - Hebrew linguistics, roots, poetic devices, OT terminology
3. **theological-terms.md** (15KB) - Key doctrines and their biblical foundations
4. **examples.md** (9KB) - 12 detailed examples of common errors with analysis
5. **common-mistakes.md** (9KB) - 16 interpretive fallacies and how to avoid them

Claude will automatically read these when needed:
- **Greek/Hebrew analysis files**: When analyzing original language usage
- **Theological terms**: When checking doctrinal soundness
- **Examples**: When similar error patterns are detected
- **Common mistakes**: When evaluating interpretation methods

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Verification

**Your content:** "Romans 3:23 says we are justified by grace"

**Claude's analysis:**
- Romans 3:23 actually says "all have sinned and fall short"
- Romans 3:24 talks about justification
- Severity: MEDIUM
- Recommendation: Cite Romans 3:23-24 or separate the concepts

### Example 2: Greek Word Study

**Your content:** "The Greek word for love in John 3:16 is phileo"

**Claude's analysis:**
- Checks Greek text: Actually uses ἀγαπάω (agapaō), not φιλέω (phileō)
- Severity: CRITICAL (fundamentally wrong word)
- Provides correct meaning and theological significance

### Example 3: Context Check

**Your content:** "Jeremiah 29:11 promises prosperity and success if we follow God"

**Claude's analysis:**
- Context: Written to exiles facing 70 years in Babylon
- Promise includes suffering before restoration
- Severity: HIGH (eisegesis - reading modern ideas into text)
- Provides proper interpretation

## Best Practices

### When Writing Biblical Content

1. **Cite sources properly** - Include book, chapter, and verse
2. **Quote accurately** - Check against the biblical text
3. **Consider context** - Read verses before and after
4. **Be humble about languages** - If unsure about Greek/Hebrew, ask Claude to verify
5. **Stick to orthodoxy** - Core doctrines are non-negotiable

### When Requesting Reviews

1. **Provide full text** - Include your entire sermon, devotional, or teaching
2. **Specify translation** - Mention if you're using ESV, NIV, NASB, etc.
3. **Ask specific questions** - If you want deep linguistic analysis, request it
4. **Be open to correction** - The goal is biblical accuracy, not ego protection

### After Review

1. **Prioritize CRITICAL issues** - Fix these immediately
2. **Address HIGH severity items** - Important corrections needed
3. **Consider MEDIUM suggestions** - Improve clarity and accuracy
4. **Evaluate LOW recommendations** - Enhancements, but optional

## Limitations

### What This Skill Can't Do

- **Settle denominational debates** - Allows latitude on secondary issues
- **Provide original manuscripts** - Works with standard critical texts
- **Replace seminary training** - Helpful tool, not a substitute for education
- **Guarantee certainty** - Some passages have legitimate scholarly disagreement

### When to Seek Additional Help

- Complex textual criticism questions
- Deep systematic theology debates
- Historical background requiring specialized knowledge
- Pastoral application in specific cultural contexts
