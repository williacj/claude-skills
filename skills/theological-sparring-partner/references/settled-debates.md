# Settled Theological Debates - Index

## Purpose

This file serves as a **quick-reference index** of theological positions you've thoroughly examined and settled with high confidence. Each entry provides essential information and links to detailed analysis files.

## Two-Tier System

**This Index File** (`settled-debates.md`):
- Quick overview of each settled position
- One-sentence position statement
- Key biblical support (3-5 bullets)
- Main objections addressed (brief list)
- Confidence level and date
- Link to full analysis

**Detailed Analysis Files** (`debates/[topic].md`):
- Comprehensive biblical foundation
- Full theological reasoning
- Detailed responses to all major objections
- Morphological/linguistic analysis where relevant
- Remaining questions and notes
- Complete argumentation for reference and teaching

## When to Add Entries

Add a position when you've:
1. Systematically examined major biblical texts
2. Addressed primary opposing arguments
3. Reached "reasonably confident" or higher confidence level
4. Completed enough analysis to teach/defend the position
5. Want to avoid re-examining settled ground in future discussions

## Usage Notes for AI Assistant

When a discussion touches on a topic in this index:
1. **Check the index first** - scan for relevant settled positions
2. **Load detailed file only if needed** - don't read full analysis unless discussion requires it
3. **Respect confidence levels** - "firmly convinced" positions require strong evidence to revisit
4. **Update as needed** - if new arguments emerge or confidence changes, update both index and detailed file
5. **Cross-reference** - note when settled positions relate to each other

### The Nature of the Holy Spirit and the Trinity Doctrine

**Position**: The Holy Spirit is God's power, presence, and operative essence - not a third co-equal person. Binitarian model: Father and Son are two persons in the divine family; Spirit is their shared operative power.

**Date Settled**: January 2026

**Confidence Level**: Firmly convinced

**Key Biblical Support**:
- Romans 15:13, Acts 1:8 - Spirit explicitly called "power of God"
- Romans 8:9 - "Spirit of God" = "Spirit of Christ" interchangeably (same Spirit)
- 1 Cor 2:11, Rom 8:16 - Human spirit pattern establishes personal language without separate personhood
- 86 OT + 226 NT references show continuity with no "new revelation" of Spirit as person
- Christ revealed Father 165+ times explicitly; never revealed Spirit as third person

**Main Objections Addressed**: (8 total)
1. "Another Paraclete" (John 14:16) - functional similarity, not ontological; same power that was in Christ
2. Anthropomorphism - Hebrew spirit pattern (40+ personal actions for human spirit without separate personhood)
3. Grammatical gender (ἐκεῖνος) - follows masculine παράκλητος, not revealing nature; Hebrew רוּחַ is feminine
4. Christ's revelation pattern - Father revealed 165x explicitly; Spirit as person never mentioned
5. Matt 28:19 baptismal formula - εἰς τὸ ὄνομα = "under authority of" (cf. 1 Cor 1:13); Acts uses Jesus' name alone
6. Triadic formulas - Eph 4:4-6 lists persons and non-persons in parallel (one hope, one faith, one baptism)
7. Acts 5:3-4 lying to Spirit - emissary principle, not ontological equation; accusative vs. dative cases
8. Blasphemy (Mark 3:29) - power-denial following ancient royal protocol (deny king's power = treason)
