# Covenant Context: Old and New Testament Relationship

Understanding the covenantal framework is essential for proper biblical interpretation and avoiding misapplication of Old Testament texts to the New Covenant community.

## The Biblical Covenants

### 1. Noahic Covenant (Genesis 9)
- **Parties**: God and all creation
- **Scope**: Universal, unconditional
- **Provisions**: Never again destroy earth by flood; seasons continue
- **Sign**: Rainbow
- **Application**: Still in effect; God's common grace

### 2. Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12, 15, 17)
- **Parties**: God and Abraham (and his seed)
- **Scope**: Unconditional promise (though circumcision required for participation)
- **Provisions**: Land, descendants, blessing to nations
- **Sign**: Circumcision
- **Fulfillment**: Ultimately in Christ (Gal 3:16, 29); believers are Abraham's seed

### 3. Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-24)
- **Parties**: God and Israel
- **Scope**: Conditional (blessings/curses based on obedience)
- **Provisions**: Law (moral, civil, ceremonial), priesthood, sacrifices
- **Sign**: Sabbath
- **Status**: Fulfilled and surpassed in Christ (Rom 10:4, Heb 8:13)

### 4. Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7)
- **Parties**: God and David (and his descendants)
- **Scope**: Unconditional promise of eternal throne
- **Provisions**: Eternal kingdom, house, throne

### 5. New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34)
- **Parties**: God and his people (Jew and Gentile in Christ)
- **Scope**: Unconditional in Christ; based on his finished work
- **Provisions**: Law written on hearts, forgiveness of sins, knowledge of God, Spirit's indwelling
- **Sign**: Lord's Supper (Luke 22:20)
- **Status**: Inaugurated in Christ, ongoing

## Key Distinctions: Old Covenant vs. New Covenant

| Aspect | Old Covenant (Mosaic) | New Covenant |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Basis** | Works of the Law | Grace through faith in Christ |
| **Mediator** | Moses | Jesus Christ |
| **Priesthood** | Levitical, inherited | Christ, eternal after order of Melchizedek |
| **Sacrifices** | Repeated, animal sacrifices | Once-for-all, Christ's sacrifice |
| **Access to God** | Limited (High Priest, once yearly) | Direct access through Christ |
| **Law** | External, written on stone | Internal, written on hearts by Spirit |
| **Scope** | Primarily ethnic Israel | All nations through faith |
| **Duration** | Temporary, until Christ | Eternal |
| **Promise** | Conditional blessing for obedience | Unconditional in Christ's obedience |

## Interpretive Principles for Applying the Old Testament

### 1. Recognize Fulfillment in Christ

**Principle**: Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law and Prophets (Matt 5:17).

**Examples**:
- **Sacrificial system** → Fulfilled in Christ's once-for-all sacrifice (Heb 10:1-18)
- **Priesthood** → Christ is our great High Priest (Heb 4:14-16)
- **Temple** → Christ's body; believers are temple of the Spirit (John 2:19-21; 1 Cor 6:19)
- **Dietary laws** → Declared clean in Christ (Mark 7:19; Acts 10:15)
- **Sabbath** → Rest fulfilled in Christ (Col 2:16-17; Heb 4:9-10)

**Application**: Don't require believers to practice what Christ fulfilled.

### 2. Distinguish Between Moral, Civil, and Ceremonial Law

#### Moral Law
- **Definition**: Reflects God's unchanging character
- **Examples**: Ten Commandments (murder, adultery, theft, etc.)
- **Status**: Binding on all people at all times; reaffirmed in NT
- **Application**: Christians fulfill moral law through Spirit (Rom 8:4), though not under law as means of justification

#### Civil Law
- **Definition**: Governed Israel as a theocratic nation
- **Examples**: Property laws, judicial penalties, government structure
- **Status**: Specific to Israel's theocracy; principles may apply but not literal laws
- **Application**: Extract principles (e.g., justice, equity) without imposing ancient civil code

#### Ceremonial Law
- **Definition**: Regulated worship, sacrifices, ritual purity
- **Examples**: Sacrifices, dietary laws, festivals, purity regulations
- **Status**: Fulfilled and obsolete in Christ
- **Application**: See typological significance pointing to Christ; not binding on Christians

**Critical Note**: While these categories are helpful, they weren't always distinct in OT practice. Use with discernment.

### 3. Honor the Covenant Recipients

**Principle**: Recognize who the original covenant was made with.

**Old Covenant promises to Israel:**
- Many promises were to **national Israel** as a geopolitical entity
- Land promises were about **physical territory** (Canaan)
- Blessings/curses were **covenantal** (Deuteronomy 28)

**What this means:**
- Don't directly claim Israel's covenant promises for the church or nations
- Recognize NT reinterpretation (e.g., true Israel = those in Christ, Gal 6:16; Rom 9:6-8)
- Physical land → Spiritual inheritance in Christ and new creation
- Theocratic government → Not a model for modern secular governments

**Example**: 2 Chronicles 7:14 was a specific covenant promise to Solomon's Israel regarding their land. Christians can apply *principles* (repentance, prayer) but can't claim the *promise* for America or any modern nation.

### 4. Trace Progressive Revelation

**Principle**: God's revelation unfolds progressively, with later revelation clarifying and expanding earlier revelation.

**Pattern:**
- **Shadow → Reality** (Heb 10:1)
- **Type → Antitype** (1 Peter 3:21)
- **Promise → Fulfillment** (Luke 24:44)
- **Partial → Complete** (Heb 1:1-2)

**Examples:**
- **Abraham's seed** (singular) → Christ (Gal 3:16)
- **Passover lamb** → Christ, our Passover (1 Cor 5:7)
- **Bronze serpent** → Christ lifted up (John 3:14-15)
- **Manna** → Christ, bread of life (John 6:31-35)

**Application**: Read OT in light of NT; see Christ as ultimate fulfillment.

### 5. Apply Covenant-Appropriate Ethics

**Principle**: Christians are under the New Covenant, not the Mosaic Covenant.

**What this means:**

**We are not bound by:**
- Ceremonial laws (sacrifices, dietary laws, festivals)
- Civil laws for Israel's theocracy
- Physical circumcision
- Sabbath regulations as legal requirement

**We are called to:**
- Love God and neighbor (Matt 22:37-40)
- Fulfill the "law of Christ" (Gal 6:2)
- Walk by the Spirit (Gal 5:16-25)
- Obey apostolic teaching in the NT

**Key NT Texts:**
- Romans 6:14 — "Not under law but under grace"
- Romans 10:4 — "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness"
- Galatians 3:23-25 — Law was guardian until Christ; now we're not under it
- Hebrews 8:13 — Old covenant is obsolete
- Colossians 2:16-17 — Shadows of Christ; don't be judged by ceremonial law

### 6. Avoid False Dichotomies

**Don't say:**
- "OT = law and judgment; NT = grace and love" (God is unchanging in character)
- "OT is irrelevant now" (Jesus affirmed its authority; it teaches us about God)
- "NT completely replaces OT" (NT fulfills and completes OT)

**Do say:**
- The OT reveals God, his character, his plan, and his people
- The NT shows how Christ fulfills the OT
- Moral principles rooted in God's character are timeless
- Covenantal specifics change (ceremonial/civil laws)

## Common Errors in Covenant Application

### Error 1: Applying Israel's National Promises to Modern Nations
**Example**: Claiming 2 Chronicles 7:14 for America
**Problem**: This was a covenant promise to Israel under the Mosaic Covenant
**Solution**: Apply principles (humility, prayer, repentance) without claiming the specific promise

### Error 2: Requiring OT Practices Fulfilled in Christ
**Example**: Mandating Sabbath-keeping, dietary laws, or tithing as law
**Problem**: These are either fulfilled in Christ or part of the Mosaic civil/ceremonial system
**Solution**: Recognize fulfillment; apply principles (rest, wisdom in eating, generosity) in new covenant terms

### Error 3: Spiritualizing Away All OT Promises
**Example**: Claiming there's no future for ethnic Israel or physical fulfillment of promises
**Problem**: Romans 11 and other texts suggest ongoing plan for Israel
**Solution**: Balance: many promises find ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the church, but respect ongoing mystery of Israel (Rom 11:25-29)

### Error 4: Ignoring NT Reinterpretation of OT Terms
**Example**: Reading "Israel" in OT and assuming it always means ethnic Israel today
**Problem**: NT expands/redefines terms (true Israel, children of Abraham, etc.)
**Solution**: Let NT guide understanding of OT categories in light of Christ

### Error 5: Mixing Covenants for Legalism
**Example**: Teaching that Christians must keep OT laws to maintain salvation
**Problem**: Galatians explicitly refutes this; it's "falling from grace" (Gal 5:4)
**Solution**: Affirm justification by faith; sanctification by Spirit, not law-keeping

## Practical Application Guidelines

When evaluating a sermon's use of the Old Testament:

### Questions to Ask:
1. Is the covenant context acknowledged?
2. Does the sermon recognize fulfillment in Christ?
3. Are OT commands applied as if Christians are under the Mosaic Covenant?
4. Is there confusion between Israel as a nation and the church?
5. Are ceremonial/civil laws treated as binding?
6. Does the interpretation honor NT reinterpretation of OT themes?

### Red Flags:
- Treating every OT promise as directly applicable to Christians/nations
- Requiring OT practices without acknowledging Christ's fulfillment
- Claiming health/wealth promises from OT covenant blessings
- Ignoring the "not under law" NT teaching
- Mixing law and grace as co-equal means of righteousness

### Green Flags:
- Acknowledging covenant distinctions
- Showing how Christ fulfills OT types and shadows
- Applying principles while recognizing covenant change
- Using NT texts to guide OT application
- Maintaining both continuity (God's character) and discontinuity (covenant administration)

## Recommended Reading Flow for Reviewers

When uncertain about covenant application:

1. **Identify the covenant context** of the OT passage
2. **Search for NT use** of the passage or theme
3. **Check Hebrews** (often addresses covenant transition)
4. **Consult Galatians** (for law/grace distinction)
5. **Review Romans 9-11** (for Israel/church relationship)
