# Biblical Genre Guidelines

Proper interpretation requires recognizing and respecting each genre's literary characteristics. Misapplying genre conventions leads to misinterpretation.

## Narrative (Historical Books)

### Characteristics
- Tells a story with plot, characters, setting
- Describes what happened, not necessarily what should happen
- Contains implicit theology through narrative selection and arrangement

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Look for authorial intent through narrative structure
- Identify the theological point the narrator is making
- Note patterns, repetitions, and contrasts
- Consider character development and consequences
- Ask: "Why is this story included? What is its function?"

**DON'T:**
- Treat every action as prescriptive (what characters did ≠ what we should do)
- Assume God approves of everything reported
- Ignore narrative context (characters, timing, covenant)
- Extract verses as standalone principles without narrative flow

### Examples

**Genesis 12:10-20** (Abraham lies about Sarah): Narrative reports this without explicit condemnation, but consequences and later patterns reveal it as wrong.

**Judges 11** (Jephthah's vow): Describing a tragic vow doesn't endorse it. The narrator structures Judges to show increasing chaos.

**Acts 2:44-45** (Common property): Describing early church practice in unique circumstances, not prescribing it for all churches everywhere.

## Law (Torah)

### Characteristics
- Commands, prohibitions, case laws, covenant stipulations
- Three categories: moral, civil, ceremonial
- Given in specific covenant contexts (Mosaic, primarily)

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Distinguish between moral principles and culturally specific applications
- Recognize covenant context (Mosaic Law → Israel; New Covenant → Church)
- See Jesus as fulfilling the Law (Matt 5:17)
- Apply moral principles while recognizing ceremonial/civil laws as fulfilled or obsolete
- Look for underlying theological principles

**DON'T:**
- Apply OT civil laws directly to modern governments
- Practice ceremonial laws fulfilled in Christ (dietary, sacrificial, purity)
- Ignore NT teaching on the Law's role (Rom 10:4, Gal 3:23-25, Heb 8:13)
- Cherry-pick which laws apply based on preference

### Examples

**Leviticus 19:19** (Mixed fabrics): Ceremonial purity law showing Israel's distinctiveness, not binding on Christians (Col 2:16-17).

**Exodus 21:24** (Eye for an eye): Civil law limiting retaliation in Israel's theocracy; Jesus reinterprets for new covenant ethics (Matt 5:38-42).

**Exodus 20:13** (Do not murder): Moral law reflecting God's character, universally binding.

## Wisdom Literature (Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes)

### Characteristics
- Uses aphorisms, poetry, dialogue, reflection
- Proverbs: General principles, not absolute promises
- Job/Ecclesiastes: Wrestle with life's complexities and theodicy

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Read Proverbs as wisdom for general success, not guarantees
- Recognize exceptions exist (that's why Job and Ecclesiastes are included)
- Understand parallelism and imagery
- Apply wisdom contextually with discernment
- Let Job/Ecclesiastes challenge simplistic formulas

**DON'T:**
- Treat every proverb as an unconditional promise
- Expect mechanical cause-effect outcomes
- Ignore the "under the sun" perspective in Ecclesiastes
- Use Proverbs to guarantee health/wealth outcomes

### Examples

**Proverbs 22:6** (Train a child): General principle, not absolute guarantee; godly parents can have wayward children (see 1 Sam 2:12).

**Ecclesiastes 3:1** (Time for everything): Observing life's seasons "under the sun," not prescribing activities.

**Job 1-2**: Refutes simplistic retribution theology; righteous suffer.

## Poetry (Psalms, Song of Songs, Lamentations)

### Characteristics
- Uses parallelism, metaphor, hyperbole, imagery
- Emotional and theological expression
- Often corporate/liturgical, not merely personal

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Recognize figurative language (metaphors, hyperbole)
- Identify psalm types (lament, praise, wisdom, royal, etc.)
- See Christ as ultimate fulfillment of royal/messianic psalms
- Allow emotional honesty without endorsing every sentiment
- Recognize Hebrew poetry's parallelism (synonymous, antithetical, synthetic)

**DON'T:**
- Literalize poetic imagery (God doesn't have feathers—Ps 91:4)
- Ignore structure and psalm type
- Extract single verses without the whole psalm's arc
- Treat imprecatory prayers as direct Christian ethics

### Examples

**Psalm 137:9** (Dash infants against rocks): Imprecatory prayer expressing raw emotion in exile context; not a prescriptive command.

**Psalm 139:7-8** (Cannot flee from God): Poetic description of omnipresence using merism (heaven/Sheol), not teaching about travel to hell.

**Psalm 22**: Lament that becomes messianic; Jesus quotes it on the cross.

## Prophecy (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.)

### Characteristics
- Covenant lawsuit format (indictment, judgment, restoration)
- Near/far fulfillment (immediate and distant/messianic)
- Symbolic actions and visions
- Conditional prophecies (sometimes)

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Recognize historical context (to whom, when, why)
- Distinguish near-term and long-term fulfillments
- See Christ as ultimate fulfillment of messianic prophecies
- Note covenant structure (if...then)
- Understand symbolic and apocalyptic imagery

**DON'T:**
- Rip prophecies from historical context
- Ignore NT interpretation of OT prophecies
- Assume all prophecy is about end times
- Literalize apocalyptic symbols arbitrarily

### Examples

**Isaiah 7:14** (Virgin/young woman): Near fulfillment (child in Isaiah's time) and ultimate fulfillment (Jesus—Matt 1:23).

**Jonah**: Warning to Nineveh was conditional (repentance averted judgment).

**Joel 2:28-32**: Quoted by Peter (Acts 2) as fulfilled at Pentecost, with eschatological implications.

## Gospels

### Characteristics
- Theological biographies of Jesus
- Four perspectives, different emphases
- Teaching and narrative interwoven

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Recognize each gospel's unique theological emphasis
- Distinguish Jesus' teaching under old covenant from new covenant reality
- Note differences between Jesus' earthly ministry and post-resurrection commission
- See Jesus as fulfilling OT types and promises
- Harmonize accounts while respecting each author's purpose

**DON'T:**
- Flatten all four gospels into one "super-gospel"
- Apply kingdom parables as end-times roadmaps without discernment
- Ignore progressive revelation (Jesus' teaching builds toward cross/resurrection)
- Treat every detail in parables as symbolic

### Examples

**Matthew 5-7** (Sermon on the Mount): Kingdom ethics revealing heart issues; not legalism but surpassing righteousness through transformation.

**John's Signs**: John explicitly states his selection and purpose (John 20:30-31).

**Parables**: Not allegories (every detail = something); usually one main point.

## Epistles (Letters)

### Characteristics
- Occasional documents (written to specific situations)
- Mix of theology and application
- Follow Greco-Roman letter conventions

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Identify the specific problem being addressed
- Distinguish universal principles from cultural applications
- Follow the argument's flow (not verse-by-verse isolation)
- Recognize which commands are timeless vs. cultural
- Cross-reference with other epistles for balance

**DON'T:**
- Ignore the original recipients' situation
- Universalize every cultural command without discernment
- Extract verses without argument context
- Proof-text by stringing isolated verses together

### Examples

**1 Corinthians 11:2-16** (Head coverings): Cultural expression of broader principle (honor/authority); apply principle, not necessarily form.

**Romans 13:1-7** (Submit to authorities): Paul addresses Roman Christians under Nero; principle of respect, not absolute endorsement of tyranny.

**Philemon**: Specific case of Onesimus; reveals principles of forgiveness and brotherhood.

## Apocalyptic (Revelation, Daniel 7-12)

### Characteristics
- Highly symbolic imagery
- Cosmic conflict narratives
- Encouragement under persecution
- Not straightforward prediction but theological message

### Interpretive Guidelines

**DO:**
- Recognize symbolic numbers, colors, creatures
- Study OT background (much imagery from Ezekiel, Daniel, Isaiah)
- Prioritize theological message over chronological prediction
- Read as encouragement to persecuted church
- Acknowledge interpretive humility

**DON'T:**
- Force literal interpretation of symbols
- Assume contemporary newspaper fulfillments
- Ignore literary structure and OT allusions
- Be dogmatic about debated details

### Examples

**Revelation 13** (Beast): Symbolic of anti-Christian empire (Rome in context), with ongoing application.

**Revelation 20** (1000 years): Debated interpretations (millennium views); focus on Christ's victory.

**Daniel 7** (Four beasts): Symbolic of empires; not requiring modern geopolitical mapping.

## Application Principles Across Genres

1. **Descriptive vs. Prescriptive**: Does the text describe what happened or prescribe what should happen?
2. **Cultural vs. Universal**: Is this rooted in ancient culture or transcendent principle?
3. **Covenant Context**: Old or New Covenant? How does that affect application?
4. **Christological Fulfillment**: How does Christ fulfill or reinterpret this text?
5. **Canonical Balance**: Does the rest of Scripture clarify or qualify this?
6. **Genre Conventions**: Am I reading this according to its literary type?
