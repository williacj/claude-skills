## Theological Considerations

### UCG-Specific Emphasis
- Christ returns visibly and bodily to earth
- Saints are resurrected at His return (first resurrection)
- Premillennial return - before the 1,000 year reign
- Not a secret rapture - open, visible return
- Trumpet announces both warning and victory
- Preparation matters - watching and being ready

### Common Misunderstandings to Address
- No secret rapture - the return is visible and public
- Not all trumpets in Scripture refer to Christ's return (context matters)
- The "last trumpet" is for the Church, not the last trumpet overall
- Resurrection is bodily, not just spiritual
- We don't go to heaven - Christ comes to earth
