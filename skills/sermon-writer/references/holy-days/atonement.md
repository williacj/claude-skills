## Theological Considerations

### UCG-Specific Emphasis
- Satan is the Azazel goat (scapegoat), bearing final responsibility
- The Lord's goat represents Christ's atonement
- Satan's removal is necessary for world peace and righteousness
- The day pictures both Christ's atonement and Satan's removal
- Fasting is from all food and water (sunset to sunset)
- This is a solemn, serious day

### Common Misunderstandings to Address
- Satan doesn't atone for sin (that's Christ's role) - he bears his responsibility
- The scapegoat isn't Christ (older interpretation) - two different goats, two different purposes
- We're not atoning for our sins by fasting - recognizing our dependence on God
- Fasting doesn't earn God's favor - it's commanded observance with spiritual meaning
- Atonement Day isn't just about Satan - also about reconciliation with God
