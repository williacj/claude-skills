## Theological Considerations

### UCG-Specific Emphasis
- Literal 1,000 year reign of Christ on earth (premillennial)
- Saints resurrected at Christ's return rule with Him
- Physical people alive during millennium
- Second tithe used for rejoicing at the feast
- Often observed at festival sites (temporary dwelling places)
- Command to rejoice - this is a joyous celebration
- Fall harvest represents the larger harvest (more saved than just firstfruits)

### Common Misunderstandings to Address
- Not heaven - Christ reigns on earth
- Physical people still alive, being taught God's way
- Saints have spirit bodies but interact with physical people
- People in millennium can still sin (choose to rebel or not)
- The millennium isn't the end - Last Great Day follows
- Second tithe is for feast, not general church expenses
